**Best for:** Teams migrating from or deploying to Fly.io

## Quick Start

1. **Start Minifly** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   minifly serve --dev
   ```

2. **Choose an example** and navigate to its directory:
   ```bash
   cd examples/todo-auth-app
   ```

3. **Deploy the example**:
   ```bash
   minifly deploy
   # or use the provided run script
   ./run.sh
   ```

## Creating Your Own Example

To create a new example application:

1. Create a directory under `examples/`
2. Add a `fly.toml` configuration file
3. Include a `Dockerfile` or specify a Docker image
4. Write a comprehensive `README.md`
5. (Optional) Add a `run.sh` script for easy deployment

### Example Structure

```
my-example/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fly.toml          # Minifly deployment configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile        # Container definition
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md         # Documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run.sh           # Optional deployment script
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/             # Application source code
```

## Tips for Working with Examples

- **Auto-deployment**: Run `minifly serve --dev` from an example directory to automatically deploy on startup
- **File watching**: In dev mode, changes trigger automatic redeployment
- **Logs**: Use `minifly logs <machine-id>` to debug issues
- **Cleanup**: Stop all containers with `minifly machine stop --all`

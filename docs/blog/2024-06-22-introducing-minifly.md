# Introducing Minifly 🚀

We're excited to announce **Minifly**, a local development simulator for Fly.io that brings incredible developer experience to your local machine!

<!--truncate-->

## The Problem

Developing applications for Fly.io often requires frequent deployments to test your changes. This creates a slow feedback loop:

1. Make a code change
2. Deploy to staging 
3. Wait for deployment
4. Test in browser
5. Find a bug
6. Repeat...

What if you could run the entire Fly.io platform locally?

## The Solution: Minifly

Minifly simulates the complete Fly.io environment on your local machine:

- **Full Machines API compatibility** with Docker integration
- **LiteFS integration** for distributed SQLite testing
- **Multi-region simulation** for testing regional behavior
- **Hot reloading** with watch mode for instant feedback
- **Structured logging** with region context

## Key Features

### 🚀 Incredible Developer Experience

```bash
# Start the platform
minifly serve --dev

# Deploy with watch mode
minifly deploy --watch

# Instant feedback loop!
```

### 🗄️ LiteFS Integration

Test database replication and multi-tenant architectures locally:

```rust
// Each tenant gets their own replicated database
let db_path = format!("/litefs/{}.db", tenant_id);
let pool = SqlitePool::connect(&db_path).await?;
```

### 📊 Enhanced Monitoring

Get real-time insights with structured logging:

```bash
minifly status  # Comprehensive platform status
minifly logs --follow machine-123  # Real-time logs with region context
```

## Getting Started

```bash
# Quick setup
git clone https://github.com/minifly/minifly.git
cd minifly
cargo build --release

# Initialize and start
./target/release/minifly init
./target/release/minifly serve

# Deploy your first app
minifly deploy examples/multi-tenant-app/fly.toml
```

## What's Next?

We're just getting started! Coming soon:

- 🏥 **Health checks and autoscaling** simulation
- 🌐 **Advanced networking** features
- 📦 **Volume management** with persistence
- 🔄 **CI/CD integration** helpers
- 📖 **More examples** and tutorials

## Try It Today

Minifly is open source and available now:

- **GitHub**: [github.com/minifly/minifly](https://github.com/minifly/minifly)
- **Documentation**: [Local docs](../../docs/getting-started)
- **Examples**: [Multi-tenant app example](https://github.com/minifly/minifly/tree/main/examples/multi-tenant-app)
